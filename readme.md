# HearthSpeak

HearthSpeak is a program that allows you to control Hearthstone through voice commands.

## Installation

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/evfredericksen/hearthspeak/releases/latest). Save HearthSpeak.exe anywhere and run it.

You can also clone this respository and compile the source code in Visual Studio.

## Usage

Be sure that your microphone/recording device is ready before running HearthSpeak. The first time you run Hearthspeak, Hearthstone will need to be closed or restarted to properly sync the log file.

## Is Blizzard okay with this?

According to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/ywoo_dev/status/629687548361601024), the answer appears to be yes. HearthSpeak converts speech into clicks and keystrokes however, so some caution regarding its use might be a good idea.
